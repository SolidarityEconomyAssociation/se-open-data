usage:
   #{seod} <command>

Where <command> can be:

- download
- convert
- generate
- deploy
- create_w3id
- triplestore
- run_all
- clean
- help

The operation of this script is configured by one or more
configuration files, and by appropriately named scripts, both located
in the current directory from which this command is run. 

The environment variable `SEOD_CONFIG` can be defined to name the
config file which `#{seod}` should use. If it is not set, `local.conf`
is used. Use this for developer-specific configuration which should
not be checked into the source code.

The return code of `#{seod}` indicates whether these commands succeed
or not. A zero return code indicuates success, as usual for console
commands. A non-zero value indicates something else: typically
failure.

However, the download command may return the value 100 to indicate that
either there is no download script, or that it has determined there is
no new data to download. This is so that later steps can be skipped in
this case.

For more information, read the inline documentation in `#{seod}`, here:

    #{__FILE__}

See also documentation for the modules `SeOpenData::Config` and
`SeOpenData::Cli`.

USAGE

docs = <<DOCS
SCRIPTS:

There are currently two scripts which if defined are used to implement
case-specific logic, for the `download` and `convert` commands,
respectvely. The logic can be completely custom for each
case. However, whenever possible, it is recommended that they simply
invoke general routines from the SeOpenData::Cli module. See that for
more information.

- `downloader`: if present, it should update the original data
  file. It should return a status code of 0 on success, 100 to
  indicate there is no data to download, or any other value to
  indicate failure. May be absent, for instance because there is no
  automated update mechanism.
- `converter`: this must be present, and should convert the original
  data file into the `standard.csv` file, returning 0 on success, and
  anything else indicating an error.


CONFIGURATION:

By default, a the preferred configuration file is called `local.conf`,
indicating that it is purely local to the current working copy, with
hosts and other settings for the convenience of the
developer. Therefore, this should git-ignored, and not checked into
version control.

Specifically, `local.conf` is used if the environment variable
`SEOD_CONFIG` is empty or unset.

Typically, other configuration files are also present, and checked
into version control. These can be selected by setting the environment
variable `SEOD_CONFIG` to their filename before running `#{seod}`. The
usual ones are:

- `default.conf` should contain configuration used for development
  builds and deployment if the data, using the perspective of
  automated deployment of `open-data` on a development server.

- `staging.conf` should contain configuration use for production
  builds and deployment of the data, using the persective of automated
  deployment of `open-data` on a development server.

- `production.conf` should contain configuration use for production
  builds and deployment of the data, using the persective of automated
  deployment of `open-data` on a production server.

Notice that staging and production are similar in content. The
difference is that `staging.conf` typically deploys a *development*
branch in *production* mode, whereas `production.conf` deployes a
*production* branch in *production* mode.  Historically `staging.conf`
was used to deploy a new production server which was being vetted
before being used to replace the actual production server. Production
URIs are used in both cases, but different destinations are defined.
